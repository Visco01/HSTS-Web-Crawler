## Write a security analyzer for the collected HSTS policies designed to draw conclusions about the state of security
- Rely on [SSLlabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/)

## Write a report detailing the crawling procedure, the security analysis procedure and the findings of your study

## You should do your best to ensure the representativeness, the correctness and the “reproducibility”
